Ruby Basic 1


Assignment

1) Compute the sum of cubes for a given range a through b. Write a method called sum_of_cubes to accomplish this task. Example Given range 1 to 3 the method should return 36.

2) Given an Array, return the elements that are present exactly once in the array. You need to write a method called non_duplicated_values to accomplish this task. Example: Given [1,2,2,3,3,4,5], the method should return [1,4,5].

3) Given a sentence, return true if the sentence is a palindrome. You are supposed to write a method palindrome? to accomplish this task. 
Note Ignore whitespace and cases of characters. Example: Given "Never odd or even" the method should return true.

4) 9 is a Kaprekar number since 9 ^ 2 = 81 and 8 + 1 = 9, 297 is also Kaprekar number since 297 ^ 2 = 88209 and 88 + 209 = 297. In short, for a Kaprekar number k with n-digits, if you square it and add the right n digits to the left n or n-1 digits, the resultant sum is k. Find if a given number is a Kaprekar number.

15.) Remove the HTML characters from string.
16) Print the 'RUBY' word from string 1 by traversing it using string functions
17...) Find the length of string 1 & 2.

19...) Print date after 20 days from current date
20...) Print date in array format.
